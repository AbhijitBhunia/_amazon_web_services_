network-interface.status - The status of the network interface (available ) | in-use ).
network-interface.source-dest-check - Whether the network interface performs source/destination checking. A value of true means that checking is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled. The value must be false for the network interface to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.

requester-id - The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).
reservation-id - The ID of the instance's reservation. A reservation ID is created any time you launch an instance. A reservation ID has a one-to-one relationship with an instance launch request, but can be associated with more than one instance if you launch multiple instances using the same launch request. For example, if you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If you launch ten instances using the same launch request, you also get one reservation ID.
root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1 ).
root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store ).

spot-instance-request-id - The ID of the Spot Instance request.
state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.
state-reason-message - A message that describes the state change.
subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.
tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
tenancy - The tenancy of an instance (dedicated | default | host ).
virtualization-type - The virtualization type of the instance (paravirtual | hvm ).
vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.
(dict) --
A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

DescribeAvailabilityZones
DescribeImages
DescribeInstances
DescribeKeyPairs
DescribeSecurityGroups
DescribeSnapshots
DescribeSubnets
DescribeTags
DescribeVolumes
DescribeVpcs
Name (string) --
The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

Values (list) --
One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

(string) --
InstanceIds (list) --
One or more instance IDs.

Default: Describes all your instances.

(string) --
DryRun (boolean) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
MaxResults (integer) -- The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same call.
NextToken (string) -- The token to request the next page of results.
